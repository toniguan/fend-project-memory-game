## Instructions

There are 8 different pairs of cards face down on the game board. The player starts to turn over any two cards. If the two cards match, both cards stay open. If not, both cards are flipped face down. The player continues flipping and matching cards until all cards are matching. The player needs to remember the card's location and symbol.
